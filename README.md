# Ledger

> **Ledger** is an [ESO](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com) add-on to keep tabs on your Gold income and expenses.

![Ledger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haggen/Ledger/master/ledger.jpg)

## Usage

Every time you get or spend Gold Ledger automatically adds a new record, saying who (which character), when (date and time, localized to your time zone), how much and for what reason (loot, theft, quest reward, guild store, etc...).

Type '/ledger' (or set a key binding in the control settings) to open and close the main window. There you can see a history of all your Gold transactions, as well as a summary of your finances.

## Download
