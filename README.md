# Ledger

**Ledger** is an [ESO](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com) add-on to keep tabs on your income and expenses.

Although it **still in development**, you can [use it right now](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1172-Ledger.html).

## Usage

**Ledger** has a window where you can see your transactions history. You're able to sort it by time, reason of income or expense, variation or the total balance at the time.

After you have just installed it, you'll see it in the middle of your screen.

You can assign a key to open/close this window. Alternatively, you can simply type `/ledger`.

## Roadmap

### Upcoming

1. Allow the user to filter transactions by character
2. Add missing reason labels

### Backlog

- Calculate and display statistics (i.e. net worth, totals, etc.)
- Ability to add notes to the records
- Search box
- Filter by date

**Please note** that these lists are made based on your feedback, so if you have some insight please share it with us on [this thread](http://www.esoui.com/forums/showthread.php?p=22651#post22651).
