# Ledger

**Ledger** is an [ESO](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com) add-on to keep tabs on your income and expenses.

Although it **still in development**, you can [use it right now](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1172-Ledger.html).

## Usage

**Ledger** has a window where you can see your transactions history. You're able to sort it by time, reason of income or expense, variation or the total balance at the time.

After you have just installed it, you'll see it in the middle of your screen.

You can assign a key to open/close this window. Alternatively, you can simply type `/ledger`.

## Roadmap (last update on Sun Aug 16 00:06:59 BRT 2015)

Below are two lists; the first is the immediate fixes and changes that will be done, ordered by importance; the second's of ideas for the long term that might or might not be implemented, eventually.

**Please note** that these lists are made based on your feedback, so if you have some insight please share it with us on [this thread](http://www.esoui.com/forums/showthread.php?p=22651#post22651).

1. Fix a bug where data fails to load leaving the window empty
2. Fix an error occurring on game clients using other languages than English
3. Add German localization (fine contribution from [Baertram](http://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?u=2028))
4. Allow the player to see the transactions of all characters
5. Allow the player to configure a keybinding to the Ledger window
6. Add missing reason names (thank you [dominoid](http://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?u=345))
7. Fix timestamp to consider player's timezone and localization (am/pm to 24h)

- Statistics and aggregations (i.e. net worth, totals, etc.)
- Ability to add notes to the records
- Search box

## Help wanted

If you've got the will I'd love some company and help with:

1. Accounting concepts and formulas
2. Completion and translation of the interface texts
3. Testing and feedback of user experience

Any help is really appreciated!
