# Ledger

> Keep tabs on your money.

## About

**Ledger** is an Elder Scrolls Online add-on that keeps records of your income and expenses, like in a financial spreadsheet.

It **still in development**, but you already can test it out. Get it on [ESOUI](http://www.esoui.com/addons.php).

## Usage

After your just installed it the Ledger window will be open for you, but empty. Then every time you gain or lose some money it will add a new record.

You can close it if you want, nothing will be lost. Whenever you want to see it again, just type `/ledger`.

## Roadmap

For the short/medium term I plan to:

1. Fix some issues with the scroll list and data loading
2. Add search/filter functionality for locating records more swiftly
3. Allow the user to add notes to the records
4. Add financial statistics

But it's not set in stone, and I honestly want to hear from you, what you'd like to see added ? What are your issues when managing your hard earned money ?

You can reach to me at the [Ledger's thread on ESOUI](http://www.esoui.com/forums).

## Help wanted

If you want in I'd love some company and help with:

1. Further development of the add-on code base
2. Financial concepts and formulas
3. Completion and translation of the interface texts
4. Testing and feedback of user experience

Any help is really appreciated, thanks a lot!
